            <h2>A Word From The Developer - </h2>
            <p>
                This is a handy tool for quickly turning transactional metadata into a pile of DPCIs that are ready to be pasted into TCM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some important things to note:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="attention">Always</span> double check before submission.</li>
                    <li>There may be
                        <span class="attention">too many</span> or
                        <span class="attention">too few</span> entries.</li>
                    <li>I am not responsible for incorrect evidence in TCM due to a bug in this software.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Version 1.1: No longer duplicates DPCIs related to manual markdown. Application is now signed.
                <br> Version 1.0: Now handles activated phones; does not duplicate DPCIs when reaching activation lines.
                <br> It should now correctly handle the processing of Cartwheel and coupons, as well as skip any paper bag fees.
                <br>
