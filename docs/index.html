        <h2>A Word From The Developer - </h2>
        <p>
            This is a handy tool for quickly turning transactional metadata into a pile of DPCIs that are ready to be pasted into TCM.
            </p>
        <p>
            Some important things to note:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="attention">Always</span> double check before submission.</li>
                <li>There may be <span class="attention">too many</span> or 
                    <span class="attention">too few</span> entries.</li>
                    <li>I am not responsible for incorrect evidence in TCM due to a bug in this software.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, it's pretty stable.  At the time of this writing there is a known bug on transactions involving Cartwheel which causes some items to show up twice, as well as the creation of some incorrect DPCIs.  There may also be a bug related to paper bag fees but I need to do more testing to be sure.  <br> These bugs aside, I've still found this to be useful in saving time.  In the future I'll provide a method for bug reporting as well as instructions and other documentation.
            <br>
